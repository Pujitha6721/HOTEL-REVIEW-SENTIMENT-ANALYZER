#  Hotel Review Sentiment Analyzer

This project analyzes hotel customer reviews using AI-powered Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and identify specific service-related topics such as room service, food quality, and staff behavior. It helps hotel managers gain structured insights and improve service quality.

##  Project Objectives

- Automatically classify hotel reviews into sentiment categories
- Identify and tag service-related topics from guest feedback
- Summarize reviews into structured reports for decision-making
- Help hotel managers understand areas of strength and improvement

##  Methodology

1. Data Collection  
   - Collected hotel reviews in `.xlsx` format with a single column named `review`.

2. Few-shot Prompt Setup  
   - Provided example reviews and labels to guide the model using prompt templates.

3. Model Initialization  
   - Used `google/flan-t5-xxl` via IBM watsonx.ai to perform sentiment and topic classification.

4. Review Analysis  
   - Each review passed through the model to get both sentiment and service-related topics

5. Post-processing 
   - Extracted sentiment and topic separately from model output and saved final data into Excel.
